# School_District_Analysis
Using Python to analyze trends in school performance based on standardized test scores. 

Overview

Maria, a data scientist from the city school district, has tasked us with helping her to analyze, report and present standardized test data for several schools. Initial analyses were conducted but had to revised due to evidence of academic dishonesty. Substitutions were put in place for scores received from Thomas High School’s ninth grade population so that final averages omitted their data.

Results

<<<<<<< HEAD
How is the district summary affected? The overall passing percentage went down by a little over 1%. The average reading score went up slightly as well because of the modification.
How is the school summary affected? No significant changes could be observed for the overall school summary because of the modified code.
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools? Thomas High School’s overall passing percentage went down significantly due to the omitted results.
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following: a. Math scores by grade: No significant changes could be observed for math scores by grade due to the replacement. b. Reading scores by grade: No significant changes could be observed for reading scores by grade due to the replacement c. Scores by school spending: The $630-644 bin decreased in passing percentages. d. Scores by school size: The Medium (1000-2000) bin decreased in passing percentages. e. Scores by school type: The Charter schools decreased in passing percentages.
Summary NaN’s effect:

Math and Reading Scores by Grade - Thomas High School's 9th grade class has no math or reading score data to count.
